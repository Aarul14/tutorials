As the name suggests, data-type specifies the type of the data present in the variable. Variables must be declared with a data-type. 

Two Types of Data types
## 1. Primitive

Primitive Data types specifies the type and size of the data present in variables. No additional methods.

| Data type | Description | Range | Size|
|---|---|---|---|
| int| used to store whole numbers|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|4 bytes|
|short| used to store whole numbers|-32,768 to 32,767| 2 bytes|
|long| used to store whole numbers|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807| 8 bytes|
|byte| used to store whole numbers|-128 to 127| 1 byte|
|float| used to store fractional numbers|6 to 7 decimal digits| 4 bytes|
|double| used to store fractional numbers|15 decimal digits| 8 bytes|
|boolean| can either store true or false |either true or false| 1 bit|
|char|used to store a single character|one character|2 bytes|


## 2. Non-Primitive

Non-primitive data types specifies the complex data values and it can have additional methods.

For example, strings, arrays and classes can be referred as Non-primitive data types.
