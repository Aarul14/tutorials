## IF-ELSE

When ever you want to perform a set of operations based on a condition IF-ELSE is used.

```java
if(conditional-expression)
{
    //code
} else {
    //code
}
```

You can also use if-else for nested IFs and IF-ELSE-IF ladder when multiple conditions are to be performed on a single variable.

## SWITCH

Switch is an alternative to IF-ELSE-IF ladder and to select one among many blocks of code.

```java
switch(conditional-expression){    
case value1:    
 //code    
 break;  //optional  
case value2:    
 //code    
 break;  //optional  
...    
    
default:     
 code to be executed when all the above cases are not matched;    
} 
```
