## IF-ELSE

When ever you want to perform a set of operations based on a condition IF-ELSE is used.

```py
if conditional-expression
    #code
elif conditional-expression
    #code
else:
    #code
```

### Note
Indentation is very important in Python, make sure the indentation is followed correctly 

## FOR

For loop is used to iterate over arrays(list, tuple, set, dictionary) or strings.

### example
```py
mylist=("Iphone","Pixel","Samsung")
for i in mylist:
    print(i)
```

## WHILE

While is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. Usually while is preferred when number of ierations is not known in advance.

```py
while condition  
    #code 
```
