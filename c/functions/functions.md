Functions is a sub-routine which contains set of statements. Usually functions are written when multiple calls are required to same set of statements which increases re-usuability and modularity.

Two types of functions are present in C

1. Library Functions

Library functions are the in-built functions which are declared in header files like printf(),scanf(),puts(),gets() etc.,

2. User defined functions

User defined functions are the ones which are written by the programmer based on the requirement.

## How to declare a Function

return_type function_name(parameters);
```

## How to call a Function
