## IF-ELSE

When ever you want to perform a set of operations based on a condition IF-ELSE is used.

```c
if(conditional-expression)
{
    //code
}
else
{
    //code
}
```

You can also use if-else for nested IFs and IF-ELSE-IF ladder when multiple conditions are to be performed on a single variable.

## SWITCH

Switch is an alternative to IF-ELSE-IF ladder.

```c
switch(conditional-expression){    
case value1:    
 //code    
 break;  //optional  
case value2:    
 //code    
 break;  //optional  
...    
    
default:     
 code to be executed when all the above cases are not matched;    
} 
```

} 
```

## WHILE

```c
while(condition){  
//code 
}  
```

## DO-WHILE
Do-while is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. It is mostly used when you need to execute the statements atleast once.

```c
do{  
//code 
}while(condition); 
```
